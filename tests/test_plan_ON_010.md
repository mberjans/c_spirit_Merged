# ON-010 Test Plan: Three-facet schema

## Objectives
- Define YAML schema capturing Structural, Source, and Functional facets with classes, slots, and constraints.

## Planned Tests
1. Validate sample YAML schema against the three-facet schema definition.
2. Generate dataclasses from schema and ensure required fields exist.
3. Verify constraints reject missing labels, synonyms, definitions, or xrefs.

## Out of Scope
- Loading full external ontologies.
- Performance optimization for large schemas.
