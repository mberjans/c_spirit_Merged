# INF-003 Test Plan: Configuration system

## Objectives
- Ensure configuration loading supports environment variables and YAML files.
- Validate schema using typed settings.

## Planned Tests
1. Loading from a YAML file populates a settings model.
2. Environment variables override YAML values when both exist.
3. Missing required fields produce validation errors.

## Out of Scope
- Advanced nested configuration structures.
- Integration with command-line interfaces.
